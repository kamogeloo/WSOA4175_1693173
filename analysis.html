            <p>The internet artwork that I will be analyzing is an Artwork by Protey Temen, I do not know the name of this artwork, but it stood out to me. 
                The reason why it stood out is because, just from looking at it, I related it to Lisbeth Thorlacius’
                 article about the role of aesthetics in web design. I may be reaching a little bit, but this is my reading of the artwork.</p>

    <div id="second-part">
        <div class="column left-text" id="nextParagraph">
            <p>I read this artwork as an art piece that represents bad UI design more than I did as just artwork. In Thorlacius’ article, she stated that when aesthetics
                in web design was still a new concept, designers and developers would go over the top, they would overload websites with visual elements, and this would slow
                 down the performance of the website and negatively affect the functionality and the user experience. 
           </p>
            <p>In this artwork I see chaos, there are too many elements added,
                some in 2D and some in 3D, texts are overlapping on top of other texts, challenging the readability and the access to information. The artist used the colors neon pink and
                 neon cyan for some texts that are overlapping, and according to a website called approval studio, those colors do not go together, because they are referred to as disturbing 
                 and reckless, having multiple neon colors will have them fighting for the user’s attention. 
             Another color according to the article that does not go with neon pink is green, which is also present in the artwork.</p>
            
            <p>This artwork, to me, represents the DON’Ts of User Interface design.
