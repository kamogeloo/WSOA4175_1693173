            <p>My aim in designing this website was to use all the tips that Thorlacius gave in the article <i> 
                The Role of Aesthetics in Web Design<i>. I wanted to design with the intention to communicate visually, 
                most of my design decisions were intentional, especially the use of color. </p>
            

            <p>My goal for the aesthetic for this website was to create something that looks minimalist and artsy at the same time. 
                I have done some research and I found that minimalist websites generally have just one-color background color or
                 sometimes their background color changes when they scroll to another section in their page. And so, I chose to have 
                 just one background color throughout my entire website, and so I had to find a color that would work for all my pages, 
                 but also not be too boring. I chose black with color psychology in mind, black, according to color theory/psychology connotes 
                 sophistication or power; and since I was aiming for a simplistic sophisticated design, black was the perfect color. 
                 A black background is also perfect because it makes all the elements or different colors pop, it does not clash with most if not all colors.

            <p>To determine the color that I wanted to use for my nav links and my logo, I used color psychology again and 
                I used Figma to prototype my ideas, and I ended up choosing yellow for my logo and orange for my nav links 
                and all my other links. I have watched different YouTube videos explaining color theory and I have visited 
                different web sites researching color theory, and some say that yellow represents creativity while others say
                 orange is the color that represents creativity, so I do not know which ones right and which ones are not, 
                 so I chose to use both with that connotation in mind. I wanted to communicate that I am a creative individual, especially with my logo. </p>

            <p>I added gifs to my design because I believe that gifs are a great tool in visual communication, they say a lot without using any sound. 
                I did learn that gifs can slow down the performance of a website when unoptimized, however, I will make sure that I learn how to optimize 
                them in my next iteration to improve the performance of my website and the overall user experience.</p>
                <p>Another design decision that I made was to attempt to make the layout of my blogs to not feel wordy and heavy even though they are, and the way
                     that I did that was through space. I made it so that the texts are not too close together, this I feel gives the illusion that there isnâ€™t too much text. 
                    I feel that this design decision fits with the minimalist design theme, as well as that of making the font of the heading huge.</p>
