                    <p> In this article, Thorlacius states that she uses the concept aesthetics to refer to visual, sound and interactive means of effect; she argues that there is always visual communication in websites, that every element that is included and displayed in the interface of a website communicates something to the user (Thorlacius, 2007, pg.63). The colors, the type of typography that a designer uses, and even the placement of elements on a website, communicate something to the user; and it is for this reason that Thorlacius (2007) argues that it important for designer to have knowledge about visual communication. She argues that visual symbols are part our daily lives and that is why it is important for web designers to have knowledge of graphic effects and visual symbols (and semiotics) is crucial for designers, for the communication to the users to be intentional (Thorlacius, 2007, pg.63). </p>

                    <p>In this artwork I see chaos, there are too many elements added,
                        some in 2D and some in 3D, texts are overlapping on top of other texts, challenging the readability and the access to information. The artist used the colors neon pink and
                         neon cyan for some texts that are overlapping, and according to a website called approval studio, those colors do not go together, because they are referred to as disturbing 
                         and reckless, having multiple neon colors will have them fighting for the userâ€™s attention. 
                     Another color according to the article that does not go with neon pink is green, which is also present in the artwork.</p>

                    <p>My aim with this website was to make it functional, make sure all the links and all the elements worked, I also wanted it to be very simple, not too complex. I went straight ahead and started building the website without a plan, and without wireframes. I then realized that I was having a difficult time trying to figure out the layout of my website, and only then I began wireframing for a few of my web sections. I drew on paper, and I also used Figma to prototype my layout. </p>

                    <p>My aim in designing the aesthetic for this website was to create something that looks minimalist and artsy at the same time. I have done some research and I found that minimalist websites generally have just one-color background color or sometimes their background color changes when they scroll to another section in their page. And so, I chose to have just one background color throughout my entire website, and so I had to find a color that would work for all my pages, but also not be too boring. I chose black with color psychology in mind, black, according to color theory/psychology connotes sophistication or power; and since I was aiming for a simplistic sophisticated design, black was the perfect color. A black background is also perfect because it makes all the elements or different colors pop, it does not clash with most if not all colors.</p>
