                            <p> In this article, Thorlacius states that she uses the concept aesthetics to refer to visual, sound and interactive means of effect; she argues that there is always visual communication in websites, that every element that is included and displayed in the interface of a website communicates something to the user (Thorlacius, 2007, pg.63). The colors, the type of typography that a designer uses, and even the placement of elements on a website, communicate something to the user; and it is for this reason that Thorlacius (2007) argues that it important for designer to have knowledge about visual communication. She argues that visual symbols are part our daily lives and that is why it is important for web designers to have knowledge of graphic effects and visual symbols (and semiotics) is crucial for designers, for the communication to the users to be intentional (Thorlacius, 2007, pg.63). </p>

                    <p>In this artwork I see chaos, there are too many elements added,
                        some in 2D and some in 3D, texts are overlapping on top of other texts, challenging the readability and the access to information. The artist used the colors neon pink and
                         neon cyan for some texts that are overlapping, and according to a website called approval studio, those colors do not go together, because they are referred to as disturbing 
                         and reckless, having multiple neon colors will have them fighting for the userâ€™s attention. 
                     Another color according to the article that does not go with neon pink is green, which is also present in the artwork.</p>
