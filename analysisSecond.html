            <p> In this post I will be looking at and dicussing a game called Browser Pong. Browser Pong is an internet game that was developed by Stewart Smith and published in 2010.
                 It is an experimental project that was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I believe it
                  qualifies as internet art, Ji Yong Park would agree too. Park, in an article that he wrote titled
                   <i> Design principles for interactive user experience through net art</i>, argued that net artists
                    need to experiment with the invisible elements and that is exactly what Smith did. </p>

        <div class="column left-text" >
            <p>Steward Smith built a game using internet tools that are conventionally not used as game objects or as anything other than just a canvas on which net art is displayed. 
                The game is a two-player game that can be played by two human players on the same keyboard or by one human player and a non-player character.
                 Players must check the boxes labelled human to indicate whether it is two human players playing the game or just or just one.  
           </p>
            <p id="nextParagraph">In this game player characters are represented by two windows; the player on the left side is represented by a window with red and yellow and orange
                 stripes and the one on the right by green, light-green, and yellow stripes. There is another window which represents the ball, which changes colour whenever it collides with the player windows. There is also the sound option, 
                which if turned on plays game music and sound effects for when the ‘ball’ collides with the player characters.  </p>
            
    
            <p>While playing this game I realised that the player window kept on increasing in size right after the game starts, I also noticed that the ball window also grew the more it collided with the two player windows.
                 The player windows and the ball window growing in size causes chaos in the game, the speed at which the windows were colliding increased, and with that came the colour changing at a faster speed, they had the flash effect.
                  The sound of the collision felt like it was becoming louder too and then a robotic voice is introduced, I could not however, make out what the voice was saying.
                 In my observation, I could only play the game for a few seconds before the chaos was introduced, after the chaos a window pops up alerting players who won the round. 
            </p>
            <p>I feel that this game qualifies more as internet art more than a game, it is very interactive, and I found that it forces the user to pay attention to little details. Little details such as how the developer
                 added to each and every window has a tittle name of what it is representing.</p>

        <p>So, what is the role of aesthetics in web design? The first one would be creating a perception or a profile of an organization or designer, to give users an idea of who you are as a person or an organization/company. Therefore, color theory/psychology and typography and all other fundamentals of good user interface design are important.</p>
        <p>Aesthetics must support functionality; the correct implementation of animations and visual feedback when a user is interacting with the system create a better user experience. The dynamism can aid in grabbing a user’s attention to specific parts of the website/ information. Web designers must be careful to not overdo this though, because there
             is risk of slowing down the entire web site.</p>
        <p>Aesthetics of a website must fit the theme of a website; going back to color theory/psychology, it is important for designers to know colors and what these colors connote, not only that, but they also need to understand how to create and implement color palettes on the interface.</p>
        <p>Aesthetics must be suited for the target audience; a website designed to target a young audience would typically have more images than text and they would have more animations and more use of color. While websites that are owned by the government or banks would have a “clean layout that is well organized and understands contemporary trends” (Thorlacius, 2017, pg.77).</p>
        <p>In conclusion aesthetics are important and they do aid in creating a better user experience in a web site that is already function; however, when it comes to web design, I do believe that functionality should be the most important, because what is the point of having a beautiful interface that a user cannot interact with. Another point that, it is also important for
             designer to not overuse or overdo when it comes to aesthetics, balance is important.</p>
